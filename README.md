Basic HTTP file server written in Rust
======================================

Extended from this [tutorial](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html)

## Usage
Don't. But for testing, use `cargo run`. It listens on port 7878 and will serve directory indexes and any file it can read.
